# AI based Plagiarsm Detection
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated plagiarism detection system for text and code submissions. It will identify similarities using NLP techniques, machine learning models, and syntactic analysis. The system will compare documents against academic repositories, online sources, and internal databases. It will generate detailed reports highlighting matched content and plagiarism percentages. The goal is to enhance academic integrity and ensure originality in submissions.
### Key Features:
Text Similarity Detection: Uses NLP techniques like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and deep learning models to identify copied content.
Code Plagiarism Analysis: Detects structural and logical similarities using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and token-based matching.
Source Comparison: Checks submissions against academic papers, online repositories, and internal databases for originality.
Detailed Reports: Generates plagiarism scores, highlights matched content, and provides source references for verification.
### Dataset
dataset link:jpwahle/machine-paraphrase-dataset
### Dataset Description
A machine paraphrase dataset is a collection of sentence pairs where one sentence is a paraphrased version of the other, typically generated by automated systems
**Train set**: This subset contains sentence pairs used to train the plagiarism detection model. It includes a mix of paraphrased and non-paraphrased examples, allowing the model to learn patterns, word substitutions, and structural transformations.
**Test set**:This subset is used to evaluate the model’s performance after training. It contains unseen sentence pairs to assess accuracy, generalization, and the ability to distinguish between paraphrased and non-paraphrased content.
### Libraries Required:
pandas – For handling dataset storage and manipulation
numpy – For numerical operations
nltk – For tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
spacy – For advanced NLP tasks like dependency parsing
scikit-learn – For feature extraction (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
