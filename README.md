# AI based Plagiarsm Detection
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated plagiarism detection system for text and code submissions. It will identify similarities using NLP techniques, machine learning models, and syntactic analysis. The system will compare documents against academic repositories, online sources, and internal databases. It will generate detailed reports highlighting matched content and plagiarism percentages. The goal is to enhance academic integrity and ensure originality in submissions.
### Key Features:
Text Similarity Detection: Uses NLP techniques like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and deep learning models to identify copied content.
Code Plagiarism Analysis: Detects structural and logical similarities using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and token-based matching.
Source Comparison: Checks submissions against academic papers, online repositories, and internal databases for originality.
Detailed Reports: Generates plagiarism scores, highlights matched content, and provides source references for verification.
### Dataset
dataset link:[jpwahle/machine-paraphrase-dataset](url)
### Dataset Description
A machine paraphrase dataset is a collection of sentence pairs where one sentence is a paraphrased version of the other, typically generated by automated systems
**Train set**: This subset contains sentence pairs used to train the plagiarism detection model. It includes a mix of paraphrased and non-paraphrased examples, allowing the model to learn patterns, word substitutions, and structural transformations.
**Test set**:This subset is used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance after training. It contains unseen sentence pairs to assess accuracy, generalization, and the ability to distinguish between paraphrased and non-paraphrased content.
### Libraries Required:
pandas    
numpy     
nltk    
spacy    
scikit-learn  
### Usage
Load and Preprocess Data: Use pandas to load text data, clean it with nltk/spacy, and convert it into numerical representations using TF-IDF or BERT embeddings.  
Train the Model: Apply XGBoost, SVM, or deep learning models (BERT/LSTM) to learn patterns of paraphrased and plagiarized text.  
Detect Plagiarism: Compare input text with stored documents using cosine similarity or fuzzy matching to identify similarities.  
Generate Reports: Highlight copied content, provide similarity scores, and visualize results via Flask/Streamlit.
